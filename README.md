## Agent Swarm

The swarm is a system of 5 coordinated agents that run autonomously and improve over time. Each agent has a specific role, but they all share a common memory layer — so a price fetched by the market monitor is immediately available to the workflow executor when deciding whether to trigger an automation.

**The 5 agents:**

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `market-monitor` | Fetches live prices and detects significant price moves. Writes market data to shared memory with a 5-minute TTL. Fires alerts when price change exceeds a configurable threshold |
| `sentiment-tracker` | Analyses sentiment for tokens from on-chain signals. Caches results for 15 minutes. Writes sentiment alerts when score crosses ±0.5 |
| `workflow-executor` | Finds due automations and executes them — swaps, sends, and alerts. Reads token prices from shared memory to convert USD amounts to chain units |
| `memory-manager` | Watches shared memory size. When entries exceed 50, it uses an LLM to compress the oldest 20 into a summary, then deletes the originals. Keeps the swarm lean |
| `risk-verifier` | Gates high-value actions with a fast LLM risk check. Rejected actions trigger a 10-minute cooldown on that action type. Approved actions are cached for 1 hour |

**How agents coordinate:**

- All agents read and write to a shared `swarmMemory` key-value store
- Every agent run is logged and scored in `executionScores`
- The coordinator tracks win rate and average duration per skill, then adapts thresholds automatically (via cron every 30 minutes)
- The swarm heartbeat runs every 5 minutes — jobs that go stale for 15+ minutes are auto-paused

**Example workflow:**

```
1. start_swarm
   → Starts all 5 agents

2. get_swarm_status
   → See active agents, shared memory snapshot, top execution scores

3. get_execution_scores
   → See which workflows are improving over time (score, W/L, avg duration)

4. stop_swarm
   → Stops the swarm cleanly
```

**BYOK (Bring Your Own Bankr API Key):**

Heavy swarm usage — especially the market monitor, sentiment tracker, and memory manager — calls the Bankr LLM gateway. By default, Noelclaw's platform key is used. To use your own:

1. Set `useOwnKey: true` and your `bankrApiKey` in your user settings on noelclaw.xyz
2. Pass `byok: true` in the `config` when calling `start_swarm`

```
start_swarm(config: { byok: true, enabledAgents: ["market-monitor", "risk-verifier"] })
```

## Authentication

### Wallet-native auth (automatic — no config needed)

Starting from v1.7.4, the MCP server auto-generates a wallet on first run and signs every request automatically. Your wallet address is your identity — no account, no API key, no setup required.

The wallet is stored encrypted at `~/.noelclaw/wallet.json` on your machine. It is derived from a machine key and never leaves your device.

### Session token (optional — for web users)

If you have a Noelclaw account, you can link your session for access to your account's automations, saved settings, and linked wallets:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "noelclaw": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@noelclaw/research@latest"],
      "env": {
        "NOELCLAW_SESSION_TOKEN": "your-session-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Get your session token from noelclaw.xyz → Settings → API Keys.

### Per-call USDC payment (x402)

Paid tools can also be accessed via a single USDC micropayment on Base mainnet, without any account:

1. Call any paid tool — you'll get a 402 response with the amount, wallet address, and request ID
2. Send the exact USDC amount to the wallet on Base mainnet
3. Build the payment header: `base64("<txHash>:<requestId>")`
4. Set `NOELCLAW_PAYMENT_HEADER` in your MCP config env and retry

```json
{
  "env": {
    "NOELCLAW_PAYMENT_HEADER": "<base64(txHash:requestId)>"
  }
}
```

Each payment header is single-use. Clear `NOELCLAW_PAYMENT_HEADER` after the tool call succeeds.

### Tool prices

| Tool | Price (USDC) |

| `get_market_data`, `get_token_data`, `get_latest_signal`, `get_signal_history` | Free |

## Optional: Point to a Custom Deployment

By default the MCP server uses Noelclaw's hosted backend. To use your own Convex deployment:

```bash
NOELCLAW_CONVEX_URL="https://your-deployment.convex.site" npx @noelclaw/research@latest
```

Or set it in your MCP config's `env`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "noelclaw": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@noelclaw/research@latest"],
      "env": {
        "NOELCLAW_CONVEX_URL": "https://your-deployment.convex.site"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Convex env vars (self-hosted deployments only)

| Var | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `NOEL_WALLET_ADDRESS` | Your wallet address to receive USDC payments |
| `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` | Alchemy API key for Base mainnet portfolio queries |
| `BASE_RPC_URL` | Optional Base mainnet RPC (defaults to `https://mainnet.base.org`) |

Set via `npx convex env set NOEL_WALLET_ADDRESS "0x..."` in your Convex project.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `BANKR_API_KEY not set` | Set via `npx convex env set BANKR_API_KEY "..."` in your Convex project |
| `ALCHEMY_API_KEY not set` | Set via `npx convex env set ALCHEMY_API_KEY "..."` in your Convex project |
| Tools not appearing | Restart your MCP client after adding the config |
| `Noelclaw API error: 404` | Wrong `NOELCLAW_CONVEX_URL` or Convex functions not deployed |
| Server starts but no response | Expected — it waits for MCP stdin, not HTTP |
| Swarm not starting | Make sure Convex is deployed with the swarm files (`swarm.ts`, `swarmCoordinator.ts`, `swarmDb.ts`) |
| `get_swarm_status` returns empty | Start the swarm first with `start_swarm` |
| High token usage in swarm | Enable BYOK in your user settings to use your own Bankr API key |
| `Payment required` on every call | Upgrade to v1.7.4 — wallet auth is automatic in this version |
| `Payment already used` error | Each `NOELCLAW_PAYMENT_HEADER` is single-use — clear it after a successful call |
| `No matching USDC transfer found` | Make sure you sent to the exact address and amount shown in the 402 response |
| `NOEL_WALLET_ADDRESS not configured` | Self-hosted only — set via `npx convex env set NOEL_WALLET_ADDRESS "0x..."` |
